# Surfs_up
vs code, jupyter notebook, SQLite database

## Overview
This project is to analyze the weather to decide if Oahu, HI has good enough weather to start up a Surf and Ice Cream Shop. First I analyzed a whole year of precipitation, then gathered the temperature stats for June and December. 

## Results 

* Previous Year's Precipitation

* The average temperature's from December and June are very simular. 
* June's max temperature is 85 degrees only 2 degrees higher than December. 
* Decembers minimum temperature is 56 degrees which may be a little too cold to have ice cream. 
* June's minimum temperature is 64 degrees which can also lower ice cream sales. 

## Summary
The average temperature between the months isn't ideal for Ice Cream. Depending on average Percipitation surfing may not be the best place as well. I would gather a few more locations stats to make a definite decision on where the shop should be located. Wind and percipitation stats should also be considered for each location.
